Query: What is anxiety?

ðŸ§  SukoonAI Bilingual Answer

[English] Anxiety is that feeling of fear or unease that can sometimes creep up on us. It might make your heart race, cause you to sweat, or leave you feeling restless. It's totally normal to feel anxious in certain situations, like before a big test or when facing a tough decision at work. But when those feelings become overwhelming and happen almost every day, it might be a sign of an anxiety disorder.

[Roman Urdu] Anxiety wo ehsaas hai jo kabhi kabhi humein dar ya bechaini ka shikaar kar deta hai. Is se aapka dil tez chal sakta hai, aap paseena pasina ho sakte hain, ya bechain mehsoos kar sakte hain. Yeh bilkul normal hai jab aap kisi mushkil ka samna kar rahe hote hain, jaise kisi imtihan se pehle ya kaam par kisi mushkil faislay ke waqt. Lekin jab yeh feelings itni zyada ho jayein ke rozana mehsoos hon, toh yeh anxiety disorder ka nishan ho sakta hai. (Source: MedlinePlus / WHO)

[English] Depression can show up in different ways, and itâ€™s not just about feeling sad. You might notice changes in your sleep, like sleeping too much or not enough, or you could feel really tired all the time. Sometimes, people might get irritable or angry instead of feeling sad, especially men. It can also affect how you think and handle daily life, making everything feel a bit heavier. 

[Roman Urdu] Depression ki alamat har shakhs mein alag hoti hain, aur sirf udasi tak mehsoos nahi hoti. Aapko neend mein tabdeeli mehsoos ho sakti hai, jaise zyada ya kam sona, ya phir aap hamesha thake hue mehsoos karte hain. Kabhi kabhi log udas hone ki bajaye gusse ya chidhchidhahat ka izhar karte hain, khaaskar mardon mein. Yeh aapki soch aur rozana zindagi par bhi asar daal sakta hai, sab kuch thoda bhari mehsoos hota hai. (Source: MedlinePlus / WHO)
