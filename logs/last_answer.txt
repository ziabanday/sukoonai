Depression can show up in different ways for different people. Some might feel really sad or irritable for a long time. Others may feel tired all the time or lose interest in things they used to enjoy. Itâ€™s also common to have trouble sleeping or to sleep too much. If you notice these feelings, itâ€™s important to talk to someone who can help.

[Roman Urdu]  
Depression har insaan mai mukhtalif andaaz mai samne aata hai. Kuch log bohot udaas ya chirchira mehsoos karte hain, aur yeh lambi muddat tak chal sakta hai. Dusre log hamesha thake hue rehte hain ya un cheezon mai dilchaspi khote hain jo pehle pasand thi. Neend bhi kharab ho sakti hai ya kabhi kabhi zyada neend aati hai. Agar aapko aise ehsaas hotay hain, to kisi se baat karna acha rahega.

Yeh aam maloomat hai, tibbi mashwara nahi. Agar unsafe mehsoos karen to madad lein.
